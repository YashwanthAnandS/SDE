Spring Interview Technical Questions

1.What is Spring?
Spring Framework is an open-source framework for building web applications with Java as a programming language.
It is powerful and lightweight yet easy to use, and it provides support for developing Java applications easily.
Spring is a lightweight framework which can be thought of as a framework of frameworks because it also offers support for various frameworks such as hibernate, struts, tapestry, and JSF.

2.Advantages of Spring Framework?
There are many advantages of Spring Framework. They are as follows:

*) Predefined Templates
Spring framework provides templates for JDBC, Hibernate, JPA etc. technologies.
So there is no need to write too much code.
It hides the basic steps of these technologies.

Let's take the example of JdbcTemplate, you don't need to write the code for exception handling, creating connection, creating statement, committing transaction, closing connection etc.
You need to write the code of executing query only.
Thus, it save a lot of JDBC code.

*) Loose Coupling
The Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection.

*) Easy to test
The Dependency Injection makes easier to test the application.
The EJB or Struts application require server to run the application but Spring framework doesn't require server.

*) Lightweight
Spring framework is lightweight because of its POJO implementation.
The Spring Framework doesn't force the programmer to inherit any class or implement any interface.
That is why it is said non-invasive.

*) Fast Development
The Dependency Injection feature of Spring Framework and it support to various frameworks makes the easy development of JavaEE application.

*) Powerful abstraction
It provides powerful abstraction to JavaEE specifications such as JMS, JDBC, JPA and JTA.

*) Declarative support
It provides declarative support for caching, validation, transactions and formatting.
